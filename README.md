Maxx Sample Activity from Breakout Group
This was a challenge where I was given a mockup, the file images, and the font and color guides and asked to create the file using HTML and CSS.
An issue I ran into was that the given font was Helvetica Neue, which is not available on my computer, so the font-family didn't match the mockup.
I also had an issue with font size. The font sizes given in the style guide did not create a strong visual hierarchy, nor did they match up with the mockup.
I chose to create a version of the file which included the font sizes as given.
...And to create a version with different font sizes for an improved visual hierarchy. 
After completing this project, I feel more comfortable with using flex containers and more confident in my ability to match visual design.
As a visual artist first, adding styling has been very frustrating since I haven't always been able to create what I want to happen, visually.
I look forward to trying to code more of my own designs.
